### Hi there! My name is Brandon. I'm a finance student, and I've recently picked up coding as a means of improving my skills.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a hedge fund competition in which we develop a quantitative investment strategy and present it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning calculus. I want to get deeper into mathematical models and really gain a good understanding.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that could entail learning something new!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with github profiles. Social media is all new to me.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really enjoy gardening.
